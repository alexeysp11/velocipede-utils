#FAQ

## Class structure

### Why are organization items associated with a user account and not an employee?

Because an employee may have several accounts. Accordingly, when it becomes necessary to send a newsletter within a company or department, it will be easier to determine which specific account to send the notification to.

### Why do we need the Organization class if we already have a Company?

The `Company` class can refer to all companies, while the `Organization` class allows you to “link” an organizational structure to a specific company.
