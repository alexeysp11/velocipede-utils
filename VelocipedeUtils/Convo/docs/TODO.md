# TODO 

- Add a database on the server side.
- TCP server should be able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
- HTTP, gRPC and WebAPI of the server could be added to the project.
- Add some web versions (Blazor, MVC, React.js) for the client-side app.
- Add audio/video calls.
- Add functionality for allowing a user to block another user in private and group chats.
- Add E2EE.
- Is byte-wise message format really better than JSON/XML or gRPC? Add some article where you compare each of the possible options.
- Add some explanation on why to use, or not to use, UDP in this application.
- Make each client know about the new message from another client almost without time latency. So clients and servers could either use **2 ports** or **RabbitMQ**.
- Add some code snippets to the **README.md** file.
- Add info about caching.
