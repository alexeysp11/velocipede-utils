## How to use this library in C# code 

You can use this library in C# code directly:

1. Clone the repository (suppose that the `csproj` file of your target project is located in the folder `C:\PathToProj\your-project`): 
```
cd C:\PathToProj\your-project
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/alexeysp11/Open-Xml-PowerTools.git 
git clone https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib.git
cd your-project
```

2. Add the reference to the repository in the `csproj` file of your target project: 
```XML
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="../../workflow-lib/src/Cims.WorkflowLib.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

## How to improve the library   

### Database connections 

- Explain what is the differnece between `DataSource` and `ConnString` in database classes and to use them properly. 
- Create template for using multiple database connections. 
- How to deal with `blob` objects in databases connection classes?
- Method `Cims.WorkflowLib.DbConnections.BaseDbConnection.GetSqlFromDataTable()` does not correct SQL statement, so you need to explain how to use this method properly. 
- How to transfer data from one database to another?
